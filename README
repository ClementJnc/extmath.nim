extmath.nim is a math library for the Nimrod programming language. It contains functions for basic math, trigonometry, and geometry, as well as quite a few constants.

It is a port of the extmath.js JavaScript library. It should work fully, but as I'm rather new to this language I can't guarantee that it will always follow the best practices.
